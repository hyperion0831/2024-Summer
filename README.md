# Introduction
1. The **Simulated Dataset Generator** comprises two distinct codes, labeled "yes" and "no". As detailed in the paper, the primary distinction between these codes lies in the adjustment of the phi value within the range of [-π, π] at line 93 of the "yes" code, which is absent in the "no" code. Consequently, the performance of "no" deteriorates as the shifted energy simply dissipates, and a greater proportion of energy is displaced beyond the image boundaries as B increases. Readers can generate datasets by themselves based on the "yes" and "no" code.  Magnetic field strength can be adjusted by changing the parameter of KBField at line 11. For example, in our paper, we use 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 1.00, 1.20, 1.40 and 1.50.

2. The **imageplotter** section contains the code responsible for generating comparative plots and tables of various standard deviations (std).

3. The **image&forms** directory serves as the repository for all comparative images generated by the imageplotter. Readers are encouraged to explore these visualizations at their discretion.

4. The **model** section encapsulates all the models referenced in our research paper.

The results of our dataset processed by different models can be found and downloaded via the following link, totaling approximately 66 GB，readers can download if you are interested：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AmdKyAnnuyBc1w7dejrMOg?pwd=gty4
